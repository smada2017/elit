			<p>In this piece of electronic literature, Christian Shaw retells the classic tale of Little Red Riding from a modern perspective while utilizing electronic literature media elements. One major element of electronic literature it implements is responsive features such as buttons, interactive objects in the story, text that changes when hovered over by the user, and changing images depending on when they are clicked or hovered on. Furthermore, the work has very little text and most of the story is told through animations and interactive elements.
			</p>
			<p>The story with its limited text and multiple drawn out scenes draws comparisons to a comic book. Similar to a comic book the majority story is told through visual scenes, but it takes it one step beyond comic books with the nonverbal elements of music and responsive elements. </p>
			<p>In addition, the story also has alternative story lines which are dependent on the interactive elements that are executed by the user. This leads to a different and interesting experience by every user because not everyone might experience the same story and it provides a variability that is usually not found in written works which are defined and constant. There is also music throughout the work and during major events of the story the music which is jazz based and during these events it alternates to more dramatic or suspenseful music. All of these elements that are distinctly found in electronic literature increase engagement between the reader compared to written texture which most of these features are not possible. </p>
