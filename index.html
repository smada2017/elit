				After interacting with the multiple examples of electronic literature and conducting research on the matter, we have decided to investigate the following research question: to what extent has responsive electronic literature affected the way we interact with literature? In response to this question, we argue that the introduction and perpetuation of electronic literature in our current culture enhances the reader’s connection with the piece because of the deeper connection they feel with the piece through their interaction with it.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first piece of electronic literature we will be using in our curation is Deviant: The Possession of Christian Shaw by Donna Leishman. This piece has no text and is completely based on interactions between the work and the author. The story is split up into scenes told through clicking different areas to initiate animations, and after every scene the story returns to the main setting which is a forest inside a city. Our next piece is Digital: A Love Story by Christine Love. This piece is an interactive platform where the reader simulates the interaction of a person and his computer with various softwares in it, and reading emails and messages being sent to him/her and seeing multiple parallel stories going on in his life unravel. Our next piece is Reality Shift by Usoki. This piece of e-literature is a “choose your own adventure” kind of story, where you read a passage and then have to react to it and make a choice about what to do next, each choice leading the story in a different direction. Our final piece of electronic literature we will be using in our curation is Regime Change by Noah Wardrip-Fruin, David Durand, Brion Moss, and Elaine Froelich. This interactive e-poetry piece involves an article about the almost assassination of Saddam Hussein in 2003. The article is littered with hyperlinks that connect to related political articles using similar language. The overall purpose of the piece is to make a statement about the universality of political language.

				Electronic literature is a new genre of poetry that exists solely digitally, relying – as Stephanie Strickland discusses in her analysis of the new e-literature – on the internet for both its creation and distribution. Leonardo Flores, the Vice-President of the Electronic Literature Organization, divided the new sub-genre into several overlapping categories: static (texts that don’t move or change on the screen), scheduled (texts that appear on a set schedule), kinetic (texts that move on the screen), mutable (texts that change), aural (texts with sound), and finally responsive (texts that require interaction from the reader). The final category of e-literature is the point of analysis for this work as the respective advantages of this work is analyzed.
			</p>

			<p>
				Scholars have argued that electronic literature poses as a revolutionary mode of transmitting or displaying literature pieces especially when considering how readers might immerse in the piece they are reading or interacting with. A UCLA PhD, Chris Mott, explains that this impact is particularly important when newer generations began learning and adapting technology into their lives since early on. Mott argues that, consequently, “digital media are the most rapidly growing forms of communication” ([number of citation]). One of the main factors he remarks as the clear distinction between the two is the interactivity many electronic literature works possess and the way they provide a way for people to engage more with the video, game, audio, or even a text enhanced by hyperlinks and other options for the reader can interact with, compared to the simple printed text. This can be clearly exemplified in the e-literature piece, Digital: A Love Story by Christine Love.  After completing the piece, one realizes that it could have easily been written as a traditional form of printed literature. However, the author creatively broke the mold and incorporated the story in a highly interactive environment where it was more appealing to follow through as it felt like I, the reader, was immersing myself in the story as the main character.
			</p>

			<p>
				The interactivity afforded to the E-poetry genre by its digital medium is a clear advantage this new form of literature over its traditional print medium predecessor, as it forces readers to find a new way to progress through the text. An example of this is Genesis which requires interaction between the reader and the text to push buttons to see more of the images and animations. The true difference in interactivity between electronic and print literature is that electronic literature has many more free variables in terms of reading, which Pressman addresses in her analysis of navigation in E-poetry, stating, “Navigating a nonlinear narrative such as a hypertext...demonstrates how electronic literature challenges expectations associated with and codified around print-based reading practices” (Pressman).
			</p>

			<p>
				Additionally, the interactive elements assist the reader in their navigation through the text. Stephanie Strickland, a member of the board of directors of the Electronic Literature Organization, justifies this in her claim that reading e-works is to “operate or play them,” which taps into the idea of how interacting with e-literature has revolutionized the way readers engage with and work through literature. She gives examples of multiple electronic literature pieces and how these are based on user input to progress in the “game” or the text giving it a modern twist. In most of these examples, the user doesn’t really know what will come but still interacts, pushed by its curiosity to progress in the story being submerged into.
			</p>
			<p>But is there such thing as too many moving parts? Many scholars argue that the chaotic nature of many interactive pieces of electronic literature hinders our ability to interact with and understand what we are reading. Rebecca Luce-Kapler, a professor of literature at Queen’s University, argues that it is indeed this inherent confusion that is characteristic of many works of e-literature that actually enhances the reader’s connection with the work. She contends that the fragmentation that happens when interactive elements are added allows the readers to connect with different emotions and parts of their consciousnesses, and it “appears to mimic for readers their experience of the fragmentation of consciousness” (Luce-Kapler 180). </p>
			<p>Some others would say that there is a disconnect between the reader and an electronic piece of literature: a lack of stimuli for the senses, or a sense of detachment from a screen. That claim is false in that electronic literature provides an interdependent link to the reader that surpasses that of traditional text. As N. Katherine Hayles states, electronic works can “[employ] animation, sound, graphics, and navigation as semiotic components working together with words to create multiple interpretive layers.” Printed literature cannot deploy the variety of modes that electronic literature “[weaves] together to create a compelling sensory experience” or be “designed to engage the user’s emotional and psychological responses” as e-literature is (Hayles). One cannot embed a video, or zoom in on a diagram to further investigate details on print.</p>
			<p>Another facet absent in traditional literature is the “shift from focusing on objects (a work, a text, a narrative) to focusing on processes, institutions, protocols, and relationships” (Pressman). Instead of mechanisms ingrained into e-literature to pull meaning from the interactivity itself, and what we are to gain from it. We can control the sequence of information online to a broader degree than that of print. Our brains branch out and can organize and learn information in a manner that best makes sense to us as individuals, rather than be limited and confined to the path a traditional author paves for us.</p>
			<p>Deviant: The Possession of Christian Shaw is an electronic literature piece written by Donna Leishman. In this work there is absolutely no text and it is a retelling of the classic Little Red Riding Hood. As a classic retelling, the story combines the classic features of the story and places a modern twist on the work through the characteristics in the mother, daughter, wolf, and grandmother. The setting takes place in a city, forest, and small house; each setting transitions through interactive touch. The entirety of the story is told through simple slides and animations and involves very little text. Each scene involves multiple interactive elements, but only a few actually progress the story forward, thus requiring the reader to think about the story and think about the story retroactively. This demonstrates the ability of electronic literature’s ability to extend beyond the realm of written communication. This relates to the overarching topic of how responsive text improves interaction with literature because Deviant: The Possession of Christian Shaw demonstrates this by increasing interaction between the reader and the work. It also has less structure than written literature which has a very specific format such as pages with paragraphs and read from right to left, but Deviant: The Possession of Christian Shaw is much more free in form and this requires more thought to navigate through the piece and enables more interpretation with the varied amount of responsive text such as animations and sound.
