			<p>This piece of electronic literature is a downloadable file that when run opens an interactive platform with the form of a computer desktop. Here, one simulates the interaction of a person and his computer. The reader interacts with the desktop to slowly unlock more softwares and passwords to access different softwares to develop the story’s plot. The main communication is done via emails and messages sent to the multiple softwares present. This way the reader interacts with the messages deciding which ones to open and which to reply to as well.
			</p>
			<p>The story itself has multiple parallel topics running along the various messages being received. At first, the main storyline seems to be a conversation with what seems as a colleague of the main character (yourself) where cyber security is the main topic of conversation. He goes ahead and sends you the first piece of software which basically gives access, with the use of a password, to a secure server where you can send and receive encrypted messages. From this initial messages a series of interactions with a distance friend start to develop as well. Soon enough the informative messages about security and encryption begin to fall to a background plane and the love letters being sent back and forth between the two lonely friends.
			</p>
			<p>This piece frames the interactivity being discussed in the essay as it is completely user driven; the story won’t advance without user input. Also, it does give the user the ability of choosing the path to take and which messages to reply. However, the story gets to a point where the reader has to reply to his lover’s messages giving no other options. Despite this predetermined nature, it doesn’t feel like it, since the story hooks the user, meaning that replying to the messages seems instinctive.
