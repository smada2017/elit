			<p>This is a “choose your own adventure” kind of story, where you read a passage and then have to react to it and make a choice about what to do next, each choice leading the story in a different direction.
			</p>
			<p>In this story, Isaac lives inside a computer generated world in which nothing is real. Through a series of choices, the reader is able to decide his choices for him and help him escape this world. This story is nice because it is short and obviously differentiates between the paths that each choice will take you on. However, it is also kind of annoying because in many chapters it severely limits the amount of choices you have to control the direction of the story. This distinction between amount of choices provides a great dichotomy between total control and no control of the path of the narrative.
			</p>
			<p>This e-literature piece is a good example of how important interactivity is to the reader’s involvement and investment in the story. In the chapters where you are given three of four options, the reader really feels like they have an impact on the outcome of the story. In contrast, when you are forced to choose the one option you are given, the reader gets a little annoyed at the predetermined direction of the story.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, this story shows how the amount of interaction affects how we the readers respond to the literature. This story is an example of a rather minimally interactive piece of e-literature, and this limited interaction severely affects the amount the reader is able to connect with the story. Each page has so many words it is very distracting from the actual interactive elements of the story. By the time you get to the interactive element, you are so exhausted by all of the reading, you don’t even care what happens to Isaac so the “choice” aspect almost feels arbitrary.
