			<p>“Regime Change” is an electronic literature piece that analyzes the similarity of political language, using hyperlinks and a base article about the possible assassination of Saddam Hussein in 2003. The article is littered with links that readers can follow to two to three other instances where similar language has been utilized. These passages have links of their own to more passages, which ultimately can be followed infinitely in the large database of collected instances of political language in American history. The colors alternate between a red background with blue hyperlinks and a blue background with red hyperlinks, showing a clear homage to the colors of the United States, and this color scheme is fitting, seeing that the collection of pieces procured by the authors represent a broad swath of American history, ranging from this assassination of President Kennedy to this possible assassination of Saddam Hussein. If the text in one of the links is highlighted, it will then replace the text in the original article, creating a roughly stitched together work with differing story lines but similar language all the same. Ultimately, the goal of this response-based piece is to allow readers to investigate for themselves the similarity of political language by showing the breadth of articles on a breadth of topics with the exact same phrasing. The element of the digital piece that drives this point home, however, is the replacement of the text with text from linked articles, because although the resulting piece is not coherent in terms of content, it is cohesive in terms of style. There is no distinct point where one article began and the other ends instead the similarity of the political language just allows the many different sources to blend together into one stylistically the same piece. Ultimately, “Regime Change” exhibits that – no matter how the times change and what political drama is unfolding – the language that the press employs to report it can always be expected to be a constant.
