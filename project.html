						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<br>
						<p>Electronic literature, as defined by Noah Wardrip-Fruin, a professor of computational literature at University of California Santa Cruz, is “work with an important literary aspect that takes advantage of the capabilities and contexts provided by the stand-alone or networked computer” (Hayles). The broad genre, which can be particularly challenging to look at as a whole, is subdivided based on the way technology was used in the work by Leonardo Flores, Vice-President of the Electronic Literature Organization: static texts which don’t move or change on the screen, scheduled texts that appear on a set schedule, kinetic texts that move on the screen, mutable texts which change, aural texts which have sound, and finally, responsive texts that require interaction from the reader (Flores). After interacting with several responsive electronic literature pieces and conducting research on the matter, we decided to investigate to what extent responsive electronic literature affects the way we interact with literature. We argue that the introduction and perpetuation of electronic literature in our current culture enhances the reader’s connection with the pieces due to the deeper connection they feel through their interaction with it.
						</p><br>
						<p>Electronic literature is a revolutionary mode of transmitting or displaying literature pieces, especially considering how readers can immerse themselves in the piece they are reading or interacting with. Chris Mott, a University of California – Los Angeles PhD, explains that the impact of electronic literature is particularly important since newer generations began learning and adopting technology into their lives early on. Mott argues that, because of this, “digital media are the most rapidly growing forms of communication” (Mott). One of the main factors he highlights as the clear distinction between print and electronic literature is the interactivity many e-literature works possess and the way they provide an avenue for people to engage more with the video, game, audio, or even text compared to the simple printed text. The distinction is clearly exemplified in the e-literature piece
							<a href"http://scoutshonour.com/digital/" class="ital">Digital: A Love Story</a>
							by Christine Love. After reading the piece, one realizes that it easily could be written as a traditional form of printed literature. However, the author creatively breaks the mold and incorporates the story into a highly interactive environment where it is more appealing to follow through, as it feels like the reader is immersing himself more into the story as the main character. The engagement and interactivity offered by the electronic literature genre is what ultimately appeals more to the modern readers.</p><br>
						<p>Additionally, the interactive elements that electronic literature affords assists the reader in their navigation through the text. Stephanie Strickland, a member of the board of directors of the Electronic Literature Organization, corroborates this, claiming that reading e-works is to “operate or play them” (Strickland). She introduces the concept that the ability to interact with e-literature revolutionizes the way readers engage with and work through literature. In most of her examples, the user doesn’t really know what will come but still interacts, pushed by their curiosity to progress further into the story. Such curiosity is specifically evident in <a href="http://hobolobo.net/" class="ital">Hobo Lobo of Hamelin</a>, a piece of e-literature in which the reader progresses through the story via clicking and scrolling through illustrations. To read through the story, the user has to physically operate and interact with it, adding another dimension of connection between the piece and the reader. The interactive elements keep the reader actively involved in the piece and enhances the reader’s experience with the piece.</p><br>
						<p>Even in its least interactive forms, electronic literature still permits an increased involvement of the reader through the use of multimodal elements. While employing the minimalistically interactive form of hyperlinks, <a href="http://collection.eliterature.org/1/aux/about.html" class="ital">Regime Change</a> utilizes the infinite nature of electronic literature (provided by the increased storage that is not confined by the number of pages) by creating numerous layers of lexias (or windows) that readers can continuously compound (Wardrip-Fruin, Durand, Moss, and Froelich). Even though hypertext pieces reside on the lower end of the spectrum in regards to physical interaction, they perhaps outrank all other forms of electronic literature for mental interaction (Aarseth 2-3). In <a href="http://collection.eliterature.org/1/aux/about.html" class="ital">Regime Change</a>, while the reader may be merely clicking blue text to open up a new lexia, their mind indexes through the previous text to draw connections to the current piece and perhaps even skims their mind for memories to supplement their reading experience. Even though there may be little expected from the reader in terms of mouse-clicking and typing, the amount of mental processing they must engage in compensates for the lack of the former (Wardrip-Fruin, Durand, Moss, and Froelich). Ultimately, hyperlink-based texts serve as a minimal baseline for reader interaction with the technology itself but still utilizes the technology to involve the reader even more.</p><br>
						<p>Furthermore, responsive elements bring variability and create even better interactions between the media and the audience compared to common printed literature, which is strictly defined and constant. <a href="http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/leishman__redridinghood/thebase.html" class="ital">RedRidingHood</a>, an electronic literature piece written by Donna Leishman, is a retelling of the classic Little Red Riding Hood with limited texts and frequent responsive elements. Both the limited written text and copious interactive elements allow the piece to tell different stories depending on the interactions. Both elements demonstrate how responsive text improves interaction with literature as <a href="http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/leishman__redridinghood/thebase.html" class="ital">RedRidingHood</a> requires more thought and responsiveness from the reader to navigate through the work. The work also has less structure than written literature, which is constricted to a very specific format, namely pages with paragraphs, and has an expectation for reading method (going from left to right). Yet, <a href="http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/leishman__redridinghood/thebase.html" class="ital">RedRidingHood</a> takes a more unrestricted form, and therefore requires more thought to navigate through the piece and enables more interpretation with the varied amount of responsive text, such as animations and sound.</p><br>
						<p>Another facet absent in traditional literature is the “shift from focusing on objects (a work, a text, a narrative) to focusing on processes, institutions, protocols, and relationships” (Pressman). Instead of mechanisms ingrained into e-literature to pull meaning from the interactivity itself, we can also benefit from it ourselves. We can control the sequence of information online to a broader degree than that of print. Our brains branch out and can organize and learn information in a manner that best makes sense to us as individuals, rather than be limited and confined to the path a traditional author paves for us. </p><br>
						<p>But is there such thing as too many moving parts? Many scholars argue that the chaotic nature of many interactive pieces of electronic literature hinders the reader's ability to interact with and understand what they are reading. For example, <em><a href="http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/niemi__stud_poetry.html" class="ital">Stud Poetry</a></em>, by Marko Niemi, is a purely interactive piece. The reader is faced with what seems to be a normal poker game, substituting words for numbers. On a superficial level, the player focuses on how to win the game, disregarding the words themselves, as they are randomly generated and do not seem to connect whatsoever. Despite the initial confusion, the player can choose to read into the author’s choices more profoundly and contemplate the significance, or precedence of some words over others. The piece exemplifies how it is indeed this inherent confusion that actually enhances the reader’s connection with the work by increasing the time that readers spend contemplating the work (Niemi). Rebecca Luce-Kapler, a professor of literature at Queen’s University, corroborates this idea, contending that the fragmentation that happens when interactive elements are added allows the readers to connect with different emotions and parts of their consciousnesses, and it “appears to mimic for readers their experience of the fragmentation of consciousness” (Luce-Kapler 180).</p><br>
						<p>Electronic literature provides an interdependent link to the reader that not only matches but surpasses the sensory stimulus of traditional text. In electronic works, one can “[employ] animation, sound, graphics, and navigation as semiotic components working together with words to create multiple interpretive layers," while printed literature cannot expand on any of these variety of modes. Electronic literature can weave information together to “create a compelling sensory experience” or be “designed to engage the user’s emotional and psychological responses” (Hayles). </p><br>
						<p>Among the multiple forms of electronic literature, responsive electronic literature is the most interactive form of all, and this high level of interactivity improves the reader’s engagement with the text. Responsive e-literature also incorporates personalized elements, enabling a unique experience for every reader that interacts with it. To conclude, the interactivity of responsive electronic literature improves the engagement and connection between the electronic literature pieces and the reader.</p><br>

						<h6>DONNA LEISHMAN</h6>
						<br>
						<p>
							In this piece of electronic literature, Donna Leishman retells the classic tale of Little Red Riding from a modern perspective while utilizing electronic literature media elements. One major element of electronic literature this piece implements is responsive features such as buttons, interactive objects in the story, text that changes when hovered over by the user, and changing images depending on when they are clicked or hovered on. On the whole, the work has very little text, and the majority of the story is told through animations and interactive elements.</p><br>
						<p>This piece, with its limited text and multiple drawn out scenes, draws many comparisons to a comic book. Similar to a comic book, the majority of the story is told through visual scenes. However, this work takes it one step beyond comic books with the use of non visual elements, such as music and responsive elements.</p><br>
						<p>In addition, the story also has alternative story lines which are dependent on the interactive elements that the user executes. This leads to different and interesting experiences for every user as not everyone will experience the same story. This “diverging storylines” aspect provides a variability that is not found in written works, which are defined and constant. There is also music playing throughout the work and during the major events of the story. The music is generally jazz-based, but during the major plot-developing events, it alternates to more dramatic and suspenseful music. All of these interactive and multimodal elements that are distinctly found in electronic literature lead to higher engagement between the reader and the story than found in written text, in which most of these features are not possible.</p><br>

						<h6>CHRISTINE LOVE</h6><br>
						<p>
							This piece of electronic literature is a downloadable file that opens an interactive platform in the form of a computer desktop. This piece simulates of the interaction of a person and his computer. The reader interacts with the desktop to slowly unlock more software and passwords to access different elements that develop the story’s plot. The main communication is done via emails and messages sent to the multiple softwares present, in which the reader can decide which ones to open and which to reply to.
						</p><br>
						<p>The story itself has multiple parallel paths that vary based on the various messages received. At first, the main storyline appears to be a conversation with what seems to be a colleague, where the conversation focuses on cyber security. This colleague goes ahead and sends you the first piece of software, which basically gives access (with the use of a password) to a secure server where you can send and receive encrypted messages. From this initial message, you also develop a series of interactions with a distant friend. Soon, the informative messages about security and encryption begin to dwindle and turn into the love letters being exchanged between the two lonely friends.
						</p><br>
						<p>This piece frames the interactivity discussed in the essay as it is completely user-driven; the story will not advance without user input. Also, it gives the user the ability to choose the path to take and which messages to reply to. However, the story eventually develops to a point where the reader has to reply to his lover’s messages without any other options. Despite the predetermined nature of this part of the story, the reader doesn’t feel supplanted, since the story hooks the user and replying to the messages seems instinctive.

						<h2><a href="http://collection.eliterature.org/1/aux/about.html">Regime Change</a></h2>
						<h6>NOAH FRUIN, DAVID DURAND, BRION MOSS, AND ELAINE FROELICH</h6>
						<br>
						<p>
							<a href="http://collection.eliterature.org/1/aux/about.html" class="ital">Regime Change</a> is an electronic literature piece that analyzes the similarity of political language, using hyperlinks and a base article about the possible assassination of Saddam Hussein in 2003. The article is littered with links that readers can follow to view two to three other instances where similar language has been utilized. These new lexias (or windows) have links of their own that lead to another layer of lexias, creating an infinite loop of new lexias that compound upon each other in the large database of collected instances of political language that capture such a broad swath of American history. With this article, the goal is not for the reader to study every passage, but for the reader to gather from the sheer volume of articles and examples the point that the author is making. Ultimately,the point that the author conveys is about the striking similarity of political language by showing the remarkable consistency of phrasing in a breadth of articles on a wide variety of topics from notably different times.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>The piece, though stylistically very simple, is purposeful in design, primarily with its color selection. Its color scheme alternates between a red background with blue hyperlinks and a blue background with red hyperlinks, a clear homage to the colors of the United States. These colors – of course – are fitting as the collection of pieces procured by the authors represent a broad swath of American history, ranging from the assassination of President Kennedy to this possible assassination of Saddam Hussein. The piece created by Wardrip-Fruin, Durand, Moss, and Froelich may be considered rudimentary, but in reality, its austere design may prevent the detraction of its text and purpose by a flashy design. </p><br>
						<p>The element of the digital piece that drives this point home, however, is the replacement of the text with text from linked articles. If the text in one of the lexias is highlighted, it will then replace the hyperlinked text in the previous article, creating a roughly stitched together work with differing storylines but similar language all the same. Although the resulting piece is not coherent in terms of content, it is cohesive in terms of style, leaving no distinct point where one article begins and the other ends. Instead, the similarity of the political language just allows the many different sources to blend together into one stylistically homogeneous piece. Ultimately, <a href="http://collection.eliterature.org/1/aux/about.html" class="ital">Regime Change</a> exhibits that, no matter how the times change and what political drama is unfolding, the language that the press employs to report it can always be expected to be a constant.

						<h6>MARKO NIEMI</h6>
						<br>
						<p>
							<a href="http://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/niemi__stud_poetry.html" class="ital">Stud Poetry</a>, by Marko Niemi, is an example of electronic literature that takes the form of a game. In particular, Niemi’s piece is a poker game composed of various words. The player sees what seems to be a normal game, however, there is no guide to which words outrank others. Each player is assigned a random word, and while suits remain the same, as do the checks, bets, and folds, there is no apparent reason why one pair of words wins over a different pair.
						</p><br>
						<p>Likewise, how the “poem” plays out is entirely up to the player, yet as the words are decided completely by chance, there is not much of a poem. The player focuses entirely on the strategy of the game or figuring out which words beat others, prohibiting the thought process behind the poetry. While the game does primarily revolve around the player’s choices, the “poetry” itself does not. The actual words are not interactive and are not blatantly related to each other. Overall, this work employs a characteristic of electronic literature that many traditional texts do not: a need to further analyze the author’s intentions and choices. Both the lack of instruction and lack of a word hierarchy causes us to ask why a pair of the word “nature” wins over a pair of the word “sound? Niemi appears to want to make the player think in depth about the meaning of words and how they relate to each other. The player must make a decision of whether or not a set of words are worth continuing on, let alone betting on.

						<h2><a href="http://hobolobo.net/">Hobo Lobo of Hamelin</a></h2>
						<h6>STEVAN ZIVADINOVIC</h6>
						<br>
						<p>
							<a href="http://hobolobo.net/" class="ital">Hobo Lobo of Hamelin</a> tells the story of a homeless wolf who is the “go-to fix-it guy” in the town of Hamelin. One day, the town mayor offers to pay him an insurmountable sum to remove the rat population from the town, which he quickly accomplishes because of his financial situation. In the typical fashion of politicians, the mayor breaks his promise and doesn’t compensate Hobo Lobo. In fact, the mayor even sues him when Hobo Lobo tries to get his hard earned pay.
						</p><br>
						<p>This piece of electronic literature is structured as an illustrated story that you scroll through. Each panel has a short paragraph outlining the story and an image associated with the action. To get from panel to panel, you either click a button or press the arrow keys to move on. One particularly interesting element of this piece of electronic literature is the structure of the illustrations. The pictures are essentially one giant panorama with multiple layers that you can scroll back and forth on using your arrow keys. This interesting and uncommon element not only makes it easier for the readers to picture the actions, but it also adds a little interactive element in a story that is otherwise pretty independent.
						</p><br>
						<p>While the story itself is an interesting read and the multi-dimensional aspects of the illustration are alluring, clicking from screen to screen and scrolling around the picture are pretty much the only types of interaction with the piece. Being based in an online platform, by not making the piece more interactive, it seems as if the piece is really missing out on some of the affordances of this mode. This limited interactivity restricts the reader’s enjoyment of the piece and investment in the story, as the feeling of control over our experience that generally accompanies high levels of interactivity enhances our individual connection with the literature and allows us to relate to it on another level – all feelings that are noticeably absent in this story. </p>
