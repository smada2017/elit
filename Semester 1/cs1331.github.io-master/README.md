# CS 1331 - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) source of the public web site for [Chris Simpkins](https://github.com/csimpkins)'s sections of CS 1331 at Georgia Tech.

## Running the Site locally

I used to include GitHub's Gemfile so that we could run the site locally using [GitHub's instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/), but GitHub insists on using that awful piece of garbage Nokogiri which means you'll need to lose hours of your life randomly every few months solving installation problems. I'm not a Ruby dev expert and I don't want to become one just so I can run GitHub Pages locally. So I removed GitHub's Gemfile and you can just run the site locally like you would any other Jekyll site:

```sh
jekyll serve
```

And visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser. Some minor Markdown rendering details may differ from GitHub when running locally.

## Generating the Schedule

I use my own [course tools](https://github.com/csimpkins/course-tools) to generate the schedule each semester. At the beginning of the semester, create a file containing the breaks. For example, `summer2017-breaks.json` (note that all dates are in [ISO 8601](https://xkcd.com/1179/) format):

```js
{
    "2017-05-29": "Memorial Day",
    "2017-07-03": "Independence Day Break",
    "2017-07-04": "Independence Day Break"
}
```

Then run `make_schedule.py` to generate a starter schedule like this:

```sh
make_schedule.py -f 2017-05-15 -l 2017-07-25 -d TR -b summer2017-breaks.json -c cs1331.json -o cs1331.summer2017
```

This will create a file named `cs1331.summer2017` with contents like:

```
Week 1
2017-05-16;intro-cs1331
2017-05-18;intro-java
Week 2
2017-05-23;values-variables
2017-05-25;programs-methods
```

You'll need to customize this file, especially for summer semesters. For the rest of the semester, you'll update the schedule by modifying this file and running `render_schedule.py` like this:

```sh
render_schedule.py -s cs1331.summer2017 -c cs1331.json -t summer2017.html.jinja2 -o summer2017.html
```

Which creates the `summer2017.html` file. (Remember to update the redirect in [`schedule.html`](schedule.html) to point to the new file at the beginning of the semester.)

If you wish, you can use a custom course materials file instead of [`cs1331.json`](cs1331.json).

### Adding Materials and Reminders

To add materials, edit the schedule file, e.g., [`cs1331.summer2017`](cs1331.summer2017) and add text to the third field. For example (note that fields are separated with semicolons, items within fields are separated with commas):

```
Week 1
2017-05-16;intro-cs1331,intro-java, values-variables;[T-Square Site](https://t-square.gatech.edu/portal/site/gtc-b435-1ace-5039-bb99-451228e2b767)
2017-05-18;control-structures, programs-methods
```

To add reminders, such as homework links, add text to the fourth field. Note that if the third field is empty, you'll have what appears to be an extra `;`. For example (note the line for 2017-05-23):

```
Week 1
2017-05-16;intro-cs1331,intro-java, values-variables; [T-Square Site](https://t-square.gatech.edu/portal/site/gtc-b435-1ace-5039-bb99-451228e2b767);[HW0 Assigned](summer2017/hw0/hw0.html)
2017-05-18;control-structures, programs-methods
Week 2
2017-05-23;arrays;;[HW0 Due](summer2017/hw0/hw0.html)
2017-05-25;data-abstraction, classes
```

Note you can make links using the Markdown `[link text](link target)` syntax.

Be sure to commit any changes to the schedule file, schedule template, and schedule to the repo.

## Slides

Some slides are HTML Reveal.js slides produced from Markdown sources. Source files use a `.md` ending. We use [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) to  [produce the slides](http://pandoc.org/README.html#producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc)

To recompile all slides:

```sh
cd slides
for file in `ls *.md`; do pandoc -s --mathjax -t revealjs -V theme=gt -V "slideNumber='c/t'" -V progress=true -o $(basename $file .md).html $file; done
```

Some slides are PDFs produced from LaTeX Beamer sources. Source files use a `.tex` ending.

As of Fall 2016 I'm moving to PDF slides produced from org-mode sources (with a `.org` ending). Students seem to prefer having printable copies (and the print CSS from Reveal.js doesn't always produce nice results), I like not having upstream changes to Reveal.js and Mathjax suddenly break my slides, and using org-mode gives me succinct source syntax like Markdown with the power of LaTeX/Beamer. Go Emacs!
