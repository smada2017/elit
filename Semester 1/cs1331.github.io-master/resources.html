<h1>Resources</h1>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>NOTE: At many points in these instructions you are told to open the "Command Prompt"/"Command Line" (Windows) or "Terminal" Mac OS X/Linux. You will be using this program a lot throughout this course and you should get familiar with it and it is reccomended that you pin it to your taskbar/dock. On Windows to open the Command Line open the start menu and search for "cmd" then click on the Command Prompt. On Mac open the Applications folder, then open the Utilities folder, from there you can open the Terminal application. On Linux the Terminal can by opened with the keyboard shortcut "ctrl-alt-t".</p>

<p>NOTE: For Mac OS X, these installation instructions rely on the software Homebrew. Open the Terminal and copy, paste, then run the command from <a href="http://brew.sh/">this website</a> to install Homebrew.</p>

<p>Some of these things are listed under other headings below, but this is a step-by-step checklist to get started in CS 1331.</p>

<ol class="simple">
<li><a href="install-java.html">Install Java</a>.</li>
<li><a href="install-gradle.html">Install Gradle</a>.</li>
<li>Choose and install a <a href="text-editors.html" target="_blank">programmer's text editor</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Installation Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li>If neither the <tt class="docutils literal">java</tt> nor <tt class="docutils literal">javac</tt> commands work, first try closing the command window and opening a new one so that the command shell reads the PATH environment variable you just updated. If that does not work, double check that the folder you added to the Path variable contains executable files like <tt class="docutils literal">java</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">javac</tt> on Unix, or <tt class="docutils literal">java.exe</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">javac.exe</tt> on Windows.</li>
<li>If <tt class="docutils literal">java</tt> works but <tt class="docutils literal">javac</tt> does not, you probably installed a Java Runtime Environment (JRE), not a Java Development Kit (JDK).  Return to Step 1 and start over.</li>
<li>If when running a gradle command you get the error message "could not find tools.jar", you need to set the JAVA_HOME <a href="environment-variables.html">environment variable</a> to the path to the jdk's bin folder.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Misc</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How to install <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a>, version control software that can be used for coding project collaboration. It is not required for this class, but you may find it useful to use git to view coding examples etc. Additionally, if you continue coding beyond cs1331 you will need to know how to use git. So why not start now? (Note: the installation process is significantly more complex for Windows than it is for a unix based operating system like Mac OS X or Linux)</li>
