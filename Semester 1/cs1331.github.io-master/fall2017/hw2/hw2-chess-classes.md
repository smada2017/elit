# Homework 2 - Chess Classes

## Introduction

In this assignment you will practice

- writing classes,
- using enums, and
- writing polymorphic classes.

## Problem Description

Your mean professor gave you a super hard homework and you need a break. In a future homework assgignment you'll re-write the PGN reader you wrote in HW1 but for now you'll write a few simple classes and an enum that you may find useful when you re-write your PGN reader.

## Solution Description

Write the following classes and enums:

- `Color` -- an enum with two values, `WHITE` and `BLACK` which represent the colors of the chess pieces.

- `Square` -- a class to represent squares on a chess board. `Square` should be instantiable and have the following constructors and methods:

  - a public constructor `Square(char file, char rank)` which uses a `file` name such as `'a'` and `rank` name such as `'1'` to  initialize instance variables that store the file and rank (as `char`s), and optionally the `String` name of the square that would be returned by `toString()` (see below). Ideally, this constructor should delegate to the other constructor, described below.

  - a public constructor `Square(String name)` which uses a square name such as `"a1"` to initialize the instance variables described in the other constructor above.

  - a public instance method `toString()` which returns a `String` representation of the square name, e.g., `"a1"`.

  - a properly written `equals` method that overrides the `equals` method from `java.lang.Object` and returns `true` for `Square` objects that have the same file and rank values, `false` otherwise.

- `Piece` -- a class to represent chess pieces (Some people distinguish between pawns and pieces, we'll call pawns pieces as well.) `Piece` should be abstract and have the following constructors and methods:

  - a public constructor that takes a `Color` parameter and stores its value in an instance variable

  - a public `getColor()` instance method that returns the `Color` of the piece

  - a public abstract instance method `algebraicName()` which returns a `String` containing the algebraic name of the piece, e.g., `""` for  pawns, or one of `"K", "Q", "B", "N", "R"`.

  - a public abstract instance method `fenName()` which returns a `String` containing the [FEN](http://www.saremba.de/chessgml/standards/pgn/pgn-complete.htm#c16.1) name for the piece.

  - a public abstract instance method `movesFrom(Square square)` which returns a `Square[]` containg all the squares the piece could move to from `square` on a chess board containing only the piece.

- A subclass of `Piece` named `King` which overrides `Piece`'s abstract methods appropriately
- A subclass of `Piece` named `Queen` which overrides `Piece`'s abstract methods appropriately
- A subclass of `Piece` named `Bishop` which overrides `Piece`'s abstract methods appropriately
- A subclass of `Piece` named `Knight` which overrides `Piece`'s abstract methods appropriately
- A subclass of `Piece` named `Rook` which overrides `Piece`'s abstract methods appropriately
- A subclass of `Piece` named `Pawn` which overrides `Piece`'s abstract methods appropriately

For each class include Javadoc comments as described in the [CS 1331 style guide](../../cs1331-style-guide.html).

We will test your classes by simply using them, for example:

```Java
Piece knight = new Knight(Color.BLACK);
assert knight.algebraicName().equals("N");
assert knight.fenName().equals("n");
Square[] attackedSquares = knight.movesFrom(new Square("f6"));
// test that attackedSquares contains e8, g8, etc.
Square a1 = new Square("a1");
Square otherA1 = new Square('a', '1');
Square h8 = new Square("h8");
assert a1.equals(otherA1);
assert !a1.equals(h8);
```

## Grading

There are many bonus points available in this assignment.

- 5 points `Color` enum
- 5 points constructor `Square(char file, char rank)`
- 5 points constructor `Square(String name)`
- 5 points `Square`'s `toString()` method
- 5 points `Square`'s `equals` method
- 5 points `Piece`'s proper declaration and constructor
- 5 points `Piece`'s `getColor()` method
- 5 points `Piece`'s `algebraicName()` method
- 5 points `Piece`'s `fenName()` method
- 5 points `Piece`'s `movesFrom(Square square)` method
- 15 points for each subclass of `Piece` being instantiable and having correct implementations of the abstract methods from 'Piece`

Checkstyle deduction will be capped at 20 points for this homework.

## Tips

- `Color` and 'Square` are easy and you need to get these right in order to get credit for other things.
- While most of `Piece` and the subclasses depend on `Color` and `Square`, we will try to grade most of `Piece` and its subclasses in isolation. Stub methods so that all classes compile and return values. That way if you, say, don't get any `movesFrom` methods working, you can still earn 110 points.

## Turn-in Procedure

Submit each of your Java source files (all nine of them!) on T-Square as separate attachments.  When you're ready, double-check that you have submitted and not just saved a draft.

## Verify the Success of Your Submission to T-Square

Practice safe submission! Verify that your HW files were truly submitted correctly, the upload was successful, and that your program runs with no syntax or runtime errors. It is solely your responsibility to turn in your homework and practice this safe submission safeguard.

- After uploading the files to T-Square you should receive an email from T-Square listing the names of the files that were uploaded and received. If you do not get the confirmation email almost immediately, something is wrong with your HW submission and/or your email. Even receiving the email does not guarantee that you turned in exactly what you intended.
- After submitting the files to T-Square, return to the Assignment menu option and this homework. It should show the submitted files.
- Download copies of your submitted files from the T-Square Assignment page placing them in a new folder.
- Re-run and test the files you downloaded from T-Square to make sure it's what you expect.
- This procedure helps guard against a few things.

    - It helps insure that you turn in the correct files.
    - It helps you realize if you omit a file or files. Missing files will not be given any credit, and non-compiling/non-running homework solutions will receive few to zero points. Also recall that late homework will not be accepted regardless of excuse. Treat the due date with respect.  Do not wait until the last minute!
(If you do discover that you omitted a file, submit all of your files again, not just the missing one.)
    - Helps find syntax errors or runtime errors that you may have added after you last tested your code.
