**IMPORTANT**: Include [CS1331 Student] in the subject of course-related email, e.g., "Subject: [CS1331 Student] Exam 2 Question." Professors are deluged with email. If we don't respond, don't take it personally. Just resend your email with a friendly reminder.

## Course Description

CS 1331 teaches students how to develop object-oriented solutions to computational problems. Students learn fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, basic object-oriented design principles, further develop the programming skills learned in previous courses, write medium-sized object-oriented programs in a modern programming language, and -- as the first course required for computer science majors and minors -- get a deeper introduction to the field of computer science.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course students will be able to define, describe and recognize examples of the principles of:

* statically typed variables;
* structured programming;
* fundamental object-oriented language features (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism);
* ad-hoc polymorphism, run-time polymorphism (subtype polymorphism) and compile-time polymorphism (generics);
* exception handling;
* event-driven programming principles as they apply to graphical user interface (GUI) programs;
* basic GUI program design;
* recursive definitions of algorithms and data structures;
* "Big-O" run time analysis of algorithms;
* basic algorithms for searching and sorting; and
* basic data structures for linked lists, stacks, and queues.

Students will also be able to write, debug and predict the behavior of programs that use these principles in programs composed of up to 20 major abstractions (e.g., classes) in up to 20 source files.

## Requirements

### Grading

* Homeworks: 20%
* Programming Quizzes: 15%
* Exams: 45%
* Final Exam: 20%

Grade Cutoffs: A: 90, B: 80, C: 70, D: 60

### Assignments

Weekly homework programming assignments, two in-class written exams, three in-class programming quizzes, and an in-class written final exam.

#### Academic Integrity and Collaboration

We expect academic honor and integrity from students. Please study and follow the academic honor code of Georgia Tech: http://www.honor.gatech.edu/content/2/the-honor-code. You may collaborate on homework assignments, but your submissions must be your own. You may not collaborate on in-class programming quizzes or exams.

#### Due Dates, Late Work, and Missed Work

* Programming assignments are submitted via T-Square. Programming quizzes are due by the end of class. Homework assignments are due at 23:55 on the due date. Multiple resubmissions are allowed, so submit early and often so you aren't in a rush on the due date. Late submissions receive a 0.

* There are no makeup exams. Exceptions are only considered under special circumstances such as serious illness, hospitalization, death in the family, judicial procedures, military service, or official school functions. Provide us with a copy of your letter from the registrar in advance for official school functions. For other excused absences you must provide documentation to the Dean of Students **within one week of your return from illness/activity**. The Dean of Students will verifiy your excuse and send us a notice. Excusal from coursework or make-up opportunities are granted at the sole discretion of your instructor.

#### Grade contest

To contest homework grades you must submit an an official regrade form to your grading TA **within one week of the assignment's original return date**. To contest quiz and exam grades you must submit an official regrade form to a TA **within one week of the assignment's original return date**. The original return date is the date the exam was first made available for students to pick up or the grade was posted online in the case of homework assignments and programming quizzes.

### Class Participation

Lecture attendance is required. Some information may be presented in lecture and nowhere else. It is your responisibility to attend lecture regularly and pay attention.

At least one of:

* Undergraduate Semester level CS 1301 Minimum Grade of C
* Undergraduate Semester level CS 1315 Minimum Grade of C
* Undergraduate Semester level CS 1321 Minimum Grade of C
* Undergraduate Semester level CS 1371 Minimum Grade of C

## Course Materials

* Required software: Java 8 SDK, available from [Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html)
* Official textbook: Introduction to Java Programming, Comprehensive Version, 10th Edition by Y. Daniel Liang, ISBN-10: 0133761312, ISBN-13: 978-0133761313
* Course websites: all course materials will be on the public web site at [http://cs1331.org](http://cs1331.org). All student grade information will be on the course's T-Square site.

* Textbook: The textbook is not required, but examples from it will be used frequently in class, therefore it is strongly recommended.
