<h1 class="title">Installing The Java Development Kit (JDK)</h1>

<div class="section" id="windows">
<h2>Windows</h2>
<ol class="arabic">

<li>First determine if your machine is 32-bit or 64-bit</li>
  <ul>
  <li style="padding-top: 5px;padding-bottom: 5px;">If you go to Local Disk (C:) (or maybe (D:)) in the File Explorer there will be a folder named "Program Files" and maybe one named "Program Files (x86)". If your Operating System is 64-bit then "Program Files" is for 64-bit programs and "Program Files (x86)" is for 32-bit programs. If your Operating System is 32-bit then you will just have "Program Files" and it will be for 32-bit programs.</li>
  </ul>
<li>If your operating system is 64-bit then you will download the Windows x64 download from Oracle. If 32-bit then you will download the Windows x86 download from Oracle. Download the appropriate installer <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">here</a>.</li>

<p>NOTE: Make sure that you download the Java Development Kit (JDK) not the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The JRE only allows you to run java programs, in order to develop your own java programs you will need the JDK.</p>

<li>Run the installer that you just downloaded. If your system is 64-bit then java will install in your "Program Files" folder. (You may also have a "java" folder in "Program Files (x86)" and you should ignore it because the java kit you are currently downloading will NOT install there.) If your system is 32-bit then java will install in your "Program Files" folder.</li>

<li>Add the path to the bin folder in the java folder that you just installed to your PATH <a href="environment-variables.html">environment variable</a>. Make sure that it is the path to the bin folder and not the path to a file inside the bin folder. eg: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\Program</span> Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_60\bin</tt></li>

<li><a href="#verification-instructions">Verify</a> that you have successfully installed java.</li>

<div class="section" id="mac-os-x">
<h2>Mac OS X</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Make sure that you have installed Homebrew before proceeding! Look at the top of the resources page on this website for instructions on installing Homebrew.</li>
<li>Run the folloing command in the Terminal:</li>
<h4>brew update</h4>
<h4>brew tap caskroom/cask</h4>
<h4>brew install Caskroom/cask/java</h4>
<p>The commands running successfully looks like this:</p>

<div class="section" id="linux">
<h2>Linux</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Download and run the appropriate Java Development Kit installer from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html#javasejdk">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html#javasejdk</a></li>
</ol>
<p>OR</p>
<blockquote>For Ubuntu and other debian based distribution, install openjdk using your default package manager (apt-get is a very common default package manager). This is the reccomended method.</blockquote>
<p>OR</p>
<blockquote>
For Fedora-based and other distros that use the Redhat Package Manager format, download the correct &quot;Linux RPM&quot; architecture from Java Downloads</blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Add the JDK's <tt class="docutils literal">bin</tt> directory to your <tt class="docutils literal">PATH</tt> environment variable, if necessary.</li>
<li><a href="#verification-instructions">Verify</a> that you have successfully installed java.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>


<h2>All Operating Systems</h2>
<h4 id="verification-instructions">To confirm that your java installation was successful:</h4>
<ul>
<li>At the command prompt type <tt class="docutils literal">java <span class="pre">-version</span></tt>. You should get output on the next line like <tt class="docutils literal">java version &quot;1.8.0_60</tt>.</li>
<li>At the command prompt type <tt class="docutils literal">javac <span class="pre">-version</span></tt>. You should get output like <tt class="docutils literal">javac 1.8.0_60</tt>.</li>
<li>The output should look something like this:</li>
<img alt="java-javac-correct-output.PNG" class="align-center" src="images/java-javac-correct-output.PNG" style="width: 480px; padding-bottom: 5px;"/>
<li>Of course if you are on Mac OS X or Linux then this will be in your Terminal not Command Prompt.</li>
<li>The version number should be "1.8*" Where the * can be any number. An older version of java will not work for the purposes of this class!</li>
</ul>


<h3>Oracle's installation instructions</h3>
<blockquote><p>Oracle, the company that makes Java, has their installation instructions <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html">here</a></p></blockquote>
