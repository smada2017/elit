# CS 1331 Java Style Guide

Style is very important when writing code. Often code is not judged simply base on how effectively it performs a specific function, but also how easily it can be understood by a human reader. While rules of style vary, it is important to be able to learn to write code which conforms to a given standard.

In this class, the style rules that you are asked to follow are crystallized into an automated tool, called Checkstyle. This tool is configurable to check for a large number of different stylistic errors. Additional details about how to run checkstyle on your code can be found here.

The file you need to run Checkstyle:

- [checkstyle-6.2.2.jar](resources/checkstyle-6.2.2.jar)

In the simplest case, run checkstyle on your Java files like so:

```sh
java -jar checkstyle-6.2.2.jar MyJavaFile.java
```

For more advanced options (which will be necessary in later portions of the semester), check out the options available for running checkstyle.
The rest of this document summarizes and in some cases clarifies Sun/Oracle's Java Code Conventions (and in some places copies it directly) and the Checkstyle checks specified in [cs1331-checkstyle.xml](resources/cs1331-checkstyle.xml). The Checkstyle web site also documents each of its standard checks here: http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/checks.html

## Names

- Class names should be capitalized camel case, as in `ClassName`.
- Method and variable names should be camel case with a lower case first letter, as in `variableName`.
-Constants (`final` variables) should be all caplital letters with words separated by underscores, as in `CONSTANT_NAME`.
- Names should be descriptive, but not excessively long. Avoid single-letter variable names. Exception: loop variables are typically `i`, `j`.

- Example:

```Java
public class ClassName {
    public static final int SOME_CONSTANT;

    private int instanceVariable;

    public int getInstanceVariable() {
        return instanceVariable;
    }
}
```

## Indentation and Line Length

- Each scope should be indented one level deeper than the previous level.
- The class declaration is not indented.
- Method names are indented one level, statements within the method by two levels, and so on.
- Indent with 4 spaces. Do not use TAB characters.
- Avoid lines longer than 80 characters.
- Use the following guidelines to break long lines:

  - Break after commas and before operators.
  - Align method parameters, or if the first line is too long indent the second and subsequent lines by 8 spaces. For example:

```Java
//CONVENTIONAL INDENTATION
someMethod(int anArg, Object anotherArg, String yetAnotherArg,
           Object andStillAnother) {
    ...
}

//INDENT 8 SPACES TO AVOID VERY DEEP INDENTS
private static synchronized horkingLongMethodName(int anArg,
        Object anotherArg, String yetAnotherArg,
        Object andStillAnother) {
    ...
}
```

- Use 8-spaces to indent subsequent line of multiple-line if statement conditions to help distinguish the condition from the body. For example:

```Java
//USE THIS INDENTATION INSTEAD
if ((condition1 && condition2)
        || (condition3 && condition4)
        ||!(condition5 && condition6)) {
    doSomethingAboutIt();
}

//OR USE THIS
if ((condition1 && condition2) || (condition3 && condition4)
        ||!(condition5 && condition6)) {
    doSomethingAboutIt();
}
```

- Indent ternary expressions as in these examples:

```Java
alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression) ? beta : gamma;

alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression) ? beta
                                 : gamma;

alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression)
         ? beta
         : gamma;
```

## Declarations and Statements

- Avoid putting more than one statement or declaration on a single line. Prefer

```Java
int width;
int height
```

to

```Java
int width, height;
```

- Avoid declaring variables of different types on the same line, as in:

```Java
int foo,  fooarray[]; //WRONG!
```

- If possible, initialize a variable where it is declared.
- Place declarations at the beginning of blocks.
- Do not put spaces between parentheses, "(" and ")", and parameter lists.
- Open brace "{" appears at the end of the same line as the declaration statement
- Closing brace "}" starts a line by itself indented to match its corresponding opening statement, except when it is a null statement the "}" should appear immediately after the "{"
- Separate methods with a blank line.
- Example:

```Java
class Sample extends Object {
    int ivar1;
    int ivar2;

    Sample(int i, int j) {
        ivar1 = i;
        ivar2 = j;
    }

    int emptyMethod() {}
    ...
}
```

- Format compound statements as in the following examples:

```Java
if (condition) {
    statements;
} else if (condition) {
    statements;
} else {
    statements;
}

for (it i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    statements;
}

while (condition) {
   statements;
}

do {
    statements;
} while (condition);

try {
    statements;
} catch (ExceptionClass e) {
    statements;
} finally {
    statements;
}
```

## Javadoc Comments

- Write Javadoc comments for the class and all public members of a class.
- Don't write Javadoc comments for private members.
- Write non-Javadoc comments for private members as necessary to explain aspects of the code that can't be expressed by the code itself. Such cases should be rare because your code should be self-documenting.
- A class comment describes the class's purpose.
- Inlcude an `@author` tag in all of your class comments with your Prism ID as your name.

Here's a small example demonstrating proper Javadoc commenting:

```Java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.Month;

/**
 * Represents an employee who is paid an hourly wage.
 *
 * @author jdoe3
 */
public class HourlyEmployee extends Employee {

    private double hourlyWage;
    private double monthlyHours;

    /**
     * Creates an HourlyEmployee with hourly wage of 20 and
     * monthly hours of 160.
     */
    public HourlyEmployee(String aName, LocalDate aHireDate) {
        this(aName, aHireDate, 20.00, 160.0);
    }

    /**
     * Creates an HourlyEmployee with all required parameters.
     *
     * @param aName the employees offical full name
     * @param aHireDate the data on which the employee was hired
     * @param anHourlyWage this employee's non-overtime hourly wage
     * @param aMonthlyHours the number of hours this employee must work every
     *                      month
     */
    public HourlyEmployee(String aName, LocalDate aHireDate,
                          double anHourlyWage, double aMonthlyHours) {
        super(aName, aHireDate);
        ValidationUtils.disallowZeroesAndNegatives(anHourlyWage,
                                                    aMonthlyHours);
        hourlyWage = anHourlyWage;
        monthlyHours = aMonthlyHours;
    }

    /**
     * @return this employee's official full name
     */
    public String getName() {
        return "Hourly: " + super.getName();
    }

    /**
     * Calculates the monthly pay of this employee by mutiplying the
     * employee's hourly wage and monthly hours.
     *
     * @return this employee's monthly pay
     */
    public double monthlyPay() {
        return hourlyWage * monthlyHours;
    }
...
}
```
