# Control Flow Issues

- Multiple vs. single entry ("How did we get here?")
- Multiple vs. single exit ("Where do we go from here?")
- ``goto`` considered harmful (``goto`` makes it hard to answer questions above)

# Structured Programming

All algorithms expressed by:

- Sequence - one statement after another
- Selection - conditional execution (not conditional jumping)
- Iteration - loops

No ``goto``

# Boolean Values

Four kinds of boolean expressions:

- ``boolean`` literals: ``true`` and ``false``
- ``boolean`` variables
- expressions formed by combining non-``boolean`` expressions with comparison operators
- expressions formed by combining ``boolean`` expressions with logical operators

# Comparison Expressions

- Equal to: ``==``, like $=$ in math

    - Remember, ``=`` is assignment operator, ``==`` is comparison operator!

- Not equal to: ``!=``, like $\ne$ in math
- Greater than: ``>``, like $>$ in math
- Greater than or equal to: ``>=``, like $\ge$ in math


# Comparison Examples

```Java
1 == 1 // true
1 != 1 // false
1 >= 1 // true
1 > 1  // false
```

# Logical Combinations

- And: `&&`, like $\land$ in math
- Or: `||`, like $\lor$ in math
Examples:
```Java
(1 == 1) &&  (1 != 1) // false
(1 == 1) ||  (1 != 1) // true
```

Also, unary negation operator ``!``:

```Java
!true     // false
!(1 == 2) // true
```

# ``if-else`` Statement

```Java
if (*booleanExpression*)
    // a single statement executed when booleanExpression is true
else
    // a single statement executed when booleanExpression is false
```

- *booleanExpression* must be enclosed in parentheses
- ``else`` not required


# ``if-else`` Example

```Java
if ((num % 2) == 0)
    System.out.printf("I like %d.%n", num);
else
    System.out.printf("I'm ambivalent about %d.%n", num);
```

# Conditional Assignment

``if-else`` is a statement, so conditional assignment like this:

```Java
String dinner = null;
if (temp > 60) {
    dinner = "grilled";
} else {
    dinner = "baked";
}
```

# Ternary If-Else Expression

The ternary operator combines the above into one expression (expressions have values):

```Java
String dinner = (temp > 60) ? "grilled" : "baked";
```

# Blocks

Enclose any number of statements in curly braces ({ ... }) to create a block, which is like a single statement.

```Java
if ((num % 2) == 0) {
    System.out.printf("%d is even.%n", num);
    System.out.println("I like even numbers.");
} else {
    System.out.printf("%d is odd.%n", num);
    System.out.println("I'm ambivalent about odd numbers.");
}
```

Always use curly braces in control structures.

# Nested ``if-else``

This is hard to follow:

```Java
if (color.toUpperCase().equals("RED")) {
    System.out.println("Redrum!");
} else {
    if (color.toLowerCase().equals("yellow")) {
        System.out.println("Submarine");
    } else {
        System.out.println("A Lack of Color");

}
```

# Multi-way ``if-else``

This multi-way ``if-else`` is equivalent, and clearer:

```Java
if (color.toUpperCase().equals("RED")) {
    System.out.println("Redrum!");
} else if (color.toLowerCase().equals("yellow")) {
    System.out.println("Submarine");
} else {
    System.out.println("A Lack of Color");
}
```

# Short-Circuit Evaluation

Common idiom for testing an operand before using it:
```Java
if ((kids !=0) && ((pieces / kids) >= 2))
    System.out.println("Each kid may have two pieces.");
```

If ``kids !=0`` evaluates to ``false``, then the second sub-expression is not evaluated, thus avoiding a divide-by-zero error.

See [Conditionals.java](https://github.com/cs1331/code-basics/blob/master/Conditionals.java) for examples.

# ``switch``

```Java
switch (expr) {
case 1:
    // executed only when case 1 holds
    break;
case 2:
    // executed only when case 2 holds
case 3:
    // executed whenever case 2 or 3 hold
    break;
default:
    // executed only when other cases don't hold
}
```

- Execution jumps to the first matching case and continues until a ``break``, ``default``, or ``switch`` statement's closing curly brace is reached
- Type of ``expr`` can be ``char``, ``int``, ``short``, ``byte``, or ``String``

# Avoid ``switch``

The ``switch`` statement is error-prone.

- ``switch`` considered harmful -- 97% of fall-throughs unintended
- Anachronism from "structured assembly language", a.k.a. C (a "switch" is just a jump table)

You can do without the ``switch``.  See

- [CharCountSwitch.java](https://github.com/cs1331/code-basics/blob/master/CharCountSwitch.java) for a ``switch`` example,
- [CharCountIf.java](https://github.com/cs1331/code-basics/blob/master/CharCountIf.java) for the same program using an ``if`` statement in place of the ``switch`` statement, and
-  [CharCount.java](https://github.com/cs1331/code-basics/blob/master/CharCount.java) for the same program using standard library utility methods.


# Repeated Operations

# Loops and Iteration

Algorithms often call for repeated action or iteration, e.g. :

-  "repeat ... while (or until) some condition is true" (looping) or
-  "for each element of this array/list/etc. ..." (iteration)

# Java Loop/Iteration Structures

-  ``while`` loop
-  ``do-while`` loop
-  ``for`` iteration statement

# ``while``

``while`` loops are pre-test loops: the loop condition is tested before the loop body is executed
```Java
while (condition) { // condition is any boolean expression
      // loop body executes as long as condition is true
}
```

# ``do-while``

``do-while`` loops are post-test loops: the loop condition is tested after the loop body is executed
```Java
do {
      // loop body executes as long as condition is true
} while (condition)
```
The body of a ``do-while`` loop will always execute at least once.


# ``for`` Statements

The general ``for`` statement syntax is:
```Java
for(initializer; condition; update) {
     // body executed as long as condition is true
}
```

-  *intializer* is a statement
-  *condition* is a boolean expression -- when ``false`` loop exits
-  *update* is a statement

# ``for`` vs. ``while``


The ``for`` statement:
```Java
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
     // body executed as long as condition is true
}
```
is equivalent to:

```Java
int i = 0
while (i < 10) {
  // body
  i++;
}
```

``for`` is Java's primary iteration structure.  In the future we'll see generalized versions, but for now ``for`` statements are used primarily to iterate through the indexes of data structures and to repeat code a particular number of times.

# Simple Repetition

And here's a simple example of repeating an action a fixed number of times:
```Java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
        System.out.println("Meow!");
```

# Iterating With Indexes

From  [CharCount.java](code/basics/CharCount.java).  We use the ``for`` loop's loop variable to index each character in a ``String``

```Java
int digitCount = 0, letterCount = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < input.length(); ++i) {
    char c = input.charAt(i);
    if (Character.isDigit(c)) digitCount++;
    if (Character.isAlphabetic(c)) letterCount++;
}
```

# Multiple Loop Variables

You can have multiple loop indexes separated by commas:

```Java
String mystery = "mnerigpaba", solved = ""; int len = mystery.length();
for (int i = 0, j = len - 1; i < len/2; ++i, --j) {
    solved = solved + mystery.charAt(i) + mystery.charAt(j);
}
```

Note that the loop above is one loop, not nested loops.

# Loop Gotchas

Beware of common "extra semicolon" syntax error:

```Java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i); // oops!  semicolon ends the statement
    print(meow);  // this will only execute once, not 10 times
```

# ``for`` Statement Subtleties


Better to declare loop index in ``for`` to limit it's scope.  Prefer:

```Java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
```

to:

```Java
int i; // Bad.  Looop index variable visible outside loop.
for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
```

# Forever

Infinite means "as long as the program is running."

With ``for``:
```Java
for (;;) {
    // ever
}
```

and with ``while``:
```Java
while (true) {
    // forever
}
```

See [Loops.java](code/Loops.java) for loop examples.


# ``break`` and ``continue``


Non-structured ways to alter loop control flow:

-  ``break`` exit the loop, possibly to a labeled location in the program
-  ``continue`` skip the remainder of a loop body and continue with the next iteration

Consider the following while loop:
```Java
boolean shouldContinue = true;
while (shouldContinue) {
    System.out.println("Enter some input (exit to quit):");
    String input = System.console().readLine();
    doSomethingWithInput(input); // We do something with "exit" too.
    shouldContinue = (input.equalsIgnoreCase("exit")) ? false : true;
}
```
We don't test for the termination sentinal, "exit," until after we do something with it.  Situations like these often tempt us to use ``break`` ...


# `break`ing out of a `while` Loop}


We could test for the sentinal and ``break`` before processing:

```Java
boolean shouldContinue = true;
while (shouldContinue) {
    System.out.println("Enter some input (exit to quit):");
    String input = System.console().readLine();
    if (input.equalsIgnoreCase("exit")) break;
    doSomethingWithInput(input);
}
```

But it's better to use structured programming:

```Java
boolean shouldContinue = true;
while (shouldContinue) {
    System.out.println("Enter some input (exit to quit):");
    String input = System.console().readLine();
    if (input.equalsIgnoreCase("exit")) {
        shouldContinue = false;
    } else {
        doSomethingWithInput(input);
    }
}
```

# Reasoning About Imperative Programs

What will this code print?

```Java
public class ShortCircuit {

    private static int counter = 0;

    private static boolean inc() {
        counter++;
        return true;
    }
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        boolean a = false;
        if (a || inc()) {
            System.out.println("Meow");
        }
        System.out.println("counter: " + counter);
        if (a && inc()) {
            System.out.println("Woof");
        }
        System.out.println("counter: " + counter);
    }
}
```
<!------------------------------------ Slide -------------------------------->
# Reasoning About Imperative Programs

Substitute values, trace code, track `counter` and output:

```Java
Code                                       counter  Output

boolean a = false;                         0
if (a || inc()) {                          1
    System.out.println("Meow");            1        Meow
}                                          1
System.out.println("counter: " + counter); 1        counter: 1
if (a && inc()) {                          1
    System.out.println("Woof");            1
}                                          1
System.out.println("counter: " + counter); 1        counter: 1
```

Key points:

- `inc()` always returns `true`
- Due to short-curcuit evaluation, `inc()` not always evaluated
